At 6-7 with a 6-10 wingspan, George has intriguing size and length, and he hit better than 40 percent of his catch-and-shoot threes last season.

He's comfortable scoring in the mid-range, and while he's capable of hitting the 3-ball, he does need to show more consistency in connecting from beyond the arc.

Newton's three-ball is inconsistent, and while he's crafty around the rim, he's not much of a vertical athlete, which could cause issues in the NBA.

How much he gets used in the post instead of simply as a pick-and-roll threat remains to be seen, but it will be an option for him. Clingan's experience with an excellent college program and his baseline of skill make him one of the more ready-made prospects in the draft.

He should be fully recovered from the ankle sprain well in advance of training camp -- if he's not healthy already -- and depending on what the complexion of the Houston roster looks like in the aftermath of the offseason, Tate could resurface as a more consistent part of head coach Ime Udoka's rotation."},

On a related note, the Cavaliers are eager to hire an offensive-minded head coach who values ball movement to get the most out of Mitchell, with the report noting that the organization has narrowed down its search to Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego, both of whom have previous head-coaching experience with the Nets and Hornets, respectively. Mitchell missed the final two games of the Cavaliers' Eastern Conference semifinal round loss to the Celtics with a left calf strain, but he's expected to be fully healthy well in advance of training camp in the fall."},

George averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game as a freshman at Miami last season and was somewhat of a surprising one-and-done player. At 6-7 with a 6-10 wingspan, George has intriguing size and length, and he hit better than 40 percent of his catch-and-shoot threes last season. With that said, he's ultimately a project player at this stage, so Washington is a decent landing spot."},

He's comfortable scoring in the mid-range, and while he's capable of hitting the 3-ball, he does need to show more consistency in connecting from beyond the arc. He finds himself in a crowded rotation in Washington, so minutes could be tough to come by early in the season."}[

He helped lead the Huskies to their second straight national title, averaging 14.0 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.5 steals over 33.0 minutes per contest in 40 total appearances. If Spencer is able to carve out a career at the NBA level, it will likely be on the back of his elite shooting ability, as he converted 44 percent of his 5.6 three-point attempts per contest at UConn."},

Wells knocked down 41.7 percent of his looks from beyond the arc, with more than half of his total field goal attempts coming from three-point range. Wells will likely spend much of his rookie season in the G League as a developmental piece."},

As a junior, Tyson took a big step forward, pacing the Bears with 19.6 points per game to go with 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.2 steals. A versatile creator who uses his size well, Tyson is capable of playing both on and off the ball, though he'll likely be asked to function as a catch-and-shoot threat early in his NBA career. Last season, Tyson knocked down 36.0 percent of his three-point attempts after shooting 40.2 percent from deep at Texas Tech in 2022-23."},
{"team": "Cavaliers", "date_time": "06/24/2024, 1:49 PM", "headline": "Extension expected this offseason", "content": "Mitchell's current contract runs through the 2025-26 season, but because he holds a $37.1 million player option for that season that he would almost certainly decline, the Cavaliers are eager to strike a long-term deal with him rather than risk losing him in free agency next summer. On a related note, the Cavaliers are eager to hire an offensive-minded head coach who values ball movement to get the most out of Mitchell, with the report noting that the organization has narrowed down its search to Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego, both of whom have previous head-coaching experience with the Nets and Hornets, respectively. Mitchell missed the final two games of the Cavaliers' Eastern Conference semifinal round loss to the Celtics with a left calf strain, but he's expected to be fully healthy well in advance of training camp in the fall."},

{"team": "Rockets", "date_time": "06/29/2024, 7:26 PM", "headline": "Option picked up by club", "content": "Houston's decision to retain Tate is somewhat surprising given that he looked to be a fringe rotation player toward the end of the 2023-24 season before he was shut down in April with a right ankle sprain. However, the 28-year-old brings value in his ability to defend multiple positions and is comfortable taking on a lower-usage role, which makes him an ideal fit next to higher-priority offensive options such as Fred VanVleet, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith and Alperen Sengun. He should be fully recovered from the ankle sprain well in advance of training camp -- if he's not healthy already -- and depending on what the complexion of the Houston roster looks like in the aftermath of the offseason, Tate could resurface as a more consistent part of head coach Ime Udoka's rotation."},

While he does have good defensive instincts, he's not particularly comfortable sliding his feet on the perimeter, and he hasn't developed much of a shooting stroke. Expect him to spend a lot of time with Houston's G League affiliate."},

While Portland shut down several key contributors with injuries late last season, the 24-year-old stepped into a focal role for Portland, averaging 16.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 0.9 steals over 30 contests with the club. Though he played well enough to stick around in Portland in 2024-25 and may even have earned himself a rotation spot, Banton is still expected to see a steep role reduction if the Trail Blazers have the likes of Jerami Grant (hamstring), Shaedon Sharpe (abdomen) and Anfernee Simons (knee) available to begin the upcoming season."},
{"team": "Trail Blazers", "date_time": "06/27/2024, 12:59 AM", "headline": "Slides to Portland at No. 7", "content": "Many mock drafts had Clingan as a Top 3 pick, so Portland getting him at No. 7 represents a slide down the board. The UConn product, with his 7-foot-2 frame, is a traditional big. He blocks shots at an elite level, rebounds, and works in the paint on offense. How much he gets used in the post instead of simply as a pick-and-roll threat remains to be seen, but it will be an option for him. Clingan's experience with an excellent college program and his baseline of skill make him one of the more ready-made prospects in the draft. That said, he will have to compete with Deandre Ayton and Robert Williams for minutes as a rookie, which is a far from ideal situation since nobody in the trio can effectively play power forward."},

Jerami Grant signed a massive extension last offseason, and Shaedon Sharpe was a lottery pick in 2022 who showed promise last season before an abdomen injury shut him down. In Portland's backcourt, Scoot Henderson and Anfernee Simons are expected to lead the way. Avdija signed a four-year, $55 million deal with Washington last season and is owed $15.6 million next season."},
