On a related note, the Cavaliers are eager to hire an offensive-minded head coach who values ball movement to get the most out of Mitchell, with the report noting that the organization has narrowed down its search to Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego, both of whom have previous head-coaching experience with the Nets and Hornets, respectively. Mitchell missed the final two games of the Cavaliers' Eastern Conference semifinal round loss to the Celtics with a left calf strain, but he's expected to be fully healthy well in advance of training camp in the fall."},

Clingan's experience with an excellent college program and his baseline of skill make him one of the more ready-made prospects in the draft.

He should be fully recovered from the ankle sprain well in advance of training camp -- if he's not healthy already -- and depending on what the complexion of the Houston roster looks like in the aftermath of the offseason, Tate could resurface as a more consistent part of head coach Ime Udoka's rotation."},
