On a related note, the Cavaliers are eager to hire an offensive-minded head coach who values ball movement to get the most out of Mitchell, with the report noting that the organization has narrowed down its search to Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego, both of whom have previous head-coaching experience with the Nets and Hornets, respectively. Mitchell missed the final two games of the Cavaliers' Eastern Conference semifinal round loss to the Celtics with a left calf strain, but he's expected to be fully healthy well in advance of training camp in the fall."},

Clingan's experience with an excellent college program and his baseline of skill make him one of the more ready-made prospects in the draft.

He should be fully recovered from the ankle sprain well in advance of training camp -- if he's not healthy already -- and depending on what the complexion of the Houston roster looks like in the aftermath of the offseason, Tate could resurface as a more consistent part of head coach Ime Udoka's rotation."},

He'll slot in as the Bulls' new backup center behind starter Nikola Vucevic, after Andre Drummond struck an agreement with the 76ers on Sunday. Though he occasionally found himself outside of coach Rick Carlisle's rotation in Indiana in 2023-24, Smith served as Myles Turner's primary backup and was productive on a per-minute basis, averaging 9.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.0 three-pointers and 0.6 blocks in 17.2 minutes per contest over 61 appearances.

The 76ers have thus locked in Maxey through the 2028-29 season, with the 23-year-old guard earning the big deal on the heels of a 2023-24 campaign in which he averaged career highs in points (25.9), assists (6.2), rebounds (3.7), three-pointers (3.0), steals (1.0), blocks (0.6) and minutes (37.5 ) over his 70 appearances while also earning his first All-Star appearance along the way. Despite coming off a breakthrough season and now being rewarded with a lavish extension, Maxey could see his offensive numbers take a slight dip during the upcoming season after the 76ers added another All-Star talent in Paul George in free agency to form a Big Three with Maxey and 2022-23 league MVP Joel Embiid."},

The 28-year-old made 68 regular-season appearances for the 76ers last year and averaged 15.4 points and 5.0 rebounds in 30.2 minutes per game. He'll likely see less usage during the 2024-25 campaign after the 76ers agreed to terms with Paul George on Monday, but Oubre will continue to be an asset in Philadelphia due to his solid scoring and rebounding abilities."},
{"team": "76ers", "date_time": "07/01/2024, 7:39 AM", "headline": "Agrees to join Philadelphia", "content": "After spending the last five seasons with the Clippers, George recently declined his player option for the 2024-25 season and informed the team that he intended to sign elsewhere. The 34-year-old will form a potent tandem in Philadelphia, joining fellow superstars Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. George's main drawback during his time with the Clippers was his trouble staying on the court, but he appeared in 74 regular-season games last year, his highest mark since the 2018-19 season. He averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.8 minutes per game, and the 76ers will be a force in the Eastern Conference if George can remain healthy with his new team."},
