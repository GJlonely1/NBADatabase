The 23-year-old will remain on a two-way pact for 2024-25 and will likely spend most of his time in the G League when the Bulls' frontcourt is at full health."},
{"team": "Bulls", "date_time": "07/01/2024, 1:48 PM", "headline": "Lands in Chicago on three-year deal", "content": "After declining his $5.42 million player option for 2024-25 on Friday, Smith will get a slight bump in salary for the upcoming season plus two extra years on his deal as he heads to Chicago. He'll slot in as the Bulls' new backup center behind starter Nikola Vucevic, after Andre Drummond struck an agreement with the 76ers on Sunday. Though he occasionally found himself outside of coach Rick Carlisle's rotation in Indiana in 2023-24, Smith served as Myles Turner's primary backup and was productive on a per-minute basis, averaging 9.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.0 three-pointers and 0.6 blocks in 17.2 minutes per contest over 61 appearances. Though his spot in Chicago's rotation should be more stable with fewer challengers for the top backup center job, Smith may not see a dramatic uptick in playing time with the Bulls so long as Vucevic stays healthy."},

The two-time MVP has never qualified for the games, but Greece is set for a trip to Paris, extending the 29-year-old's offseason action after he missed the NBA playoffs with a left soleus strain. The All-Star appeared in three FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament matchups, during which he averaged 22.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 blocks and 1.0 steals.

Antetokounmpo played in 73 regular-season games last season, during which he averaged 30.4 points, 11.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks across 35.2 minutes. The All-Star also shot a career-high 61.1 percent from the field; however, he was unable to make an appearance in the playoffs due to a left soleus strain.

The No. 33 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, the 19-year-old Smith was one of the few bright spots of G League Ignite squad that went 2-32 during the 2023-24 season. The 6-foot-9 forward appeared in 43 total games between the regular season and G League Showcase Cup, shooting 47.4 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range while averaging 13.7 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.3 triples, 1.0 blocks and 0.8 steals in only 22.2 minutes per contest. Smith will likely be on the outside looking in for a spot in the Milwaukee rotation heading into training camp, but on a Bucks team that's lacking in quality frontcourt depth, it wouldn't be surprising if he plays meaningful minutes at some point during his rookie season."},
