The 76ers have thus locked in Maxey through the 2028-29 season, with the 23-year-old guard earning the big deal on the heels of a 2023-24 campaign in which he averaged career highs in points (25.9), assists (6.2), rebounds (3.7), three-pointers (3.0), steals (1.0), blocks (0.6) and minutes (37.5 ) over his 70 appearances while also earning his first All-Star appearance along the way. Despite coming off a breakthrough season and now being rewarded with a lavish extension, Maxey could see his offensive numbers take a slight dip during the upcoming season after the 76ers added another All-Star talent in Paul George in free agency to form a Big Three with Maxey and 2022-23 league MVP Joel Embiid."},

He'll slot in as the Bulls' new backup center behind starter Nikola Vucevic, after Andre Drummond struck an agreement with the 76ers on Sunday. Though he occasionally found himself outside of coach Rick Carlisle's rotation in Indiana in 2023-24, Smith served as Myles Turner's primary backup and was productive on a per-minute basis, averaging 9.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.0 three-pointers and 0.6 blocks in 17.2 minutes per contest over 61 appearances. Though his spot in Chicago's rotation should be more stable with fewer challengers for the top backup center job, Smith may not see a dramatic uptick in playing time with the Bulls so long as Vucevic stays healthy."},

The fourth year, meanwhile, is a $2.49 million team option. The contract ensures that James will be part of the Lakers' 15-man roster to open the upcoming season, but the 19-year-old will still face an uphill battle to break training camp with a regular spot in head coach JJ Redick's rotation.
