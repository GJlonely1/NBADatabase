The 76ers have thus locked in Maxey through the 2028-29 season, with the 23-year-old guard earning the big deal on the heels of a 2023-24 campaign in which he averaged career highs in points (25.9), assists (6.2), rebounds (3.7), three-pointers (3.0), steals (1.0), blocks (0.6) and minutes (37.5 ) over his 70 appearances while also earning his first All-Star appearance along the way. Despite coming off a breakthrough season and now being rewarded with a lavish extension, Maxey could see his offensive numbers take a slight dip during the upcoming season after the 76ers added another All-Star talent in Paul George in free agency to form a Big Three with Maxey and 2022-23 league MVP Joel Embiid."},
